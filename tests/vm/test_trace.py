"""
Tests for vm/trace.py — ExecutionTrace capture across the full VM.

Reuses the P5e array-sum fixture because it exercises the four event
types we care about together: register writes (const/4, add-int),
fall-through arithmetic, taken backward branch (goto -8), and a forward
branch (if-ge to loop exit).
