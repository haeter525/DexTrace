"""
Try/catch + stub-throws integration test.

A custom stub raises `_ThrowSignal(IOException)` and the in-method catch
block recovers it. Verifies the engine's `_invoke_stub` allowlist passes
_ThrowSignal through instead of wrapping it as a generic stub-failed
DexTraceVMError (in which case the in-method catch would never see it).

Fixture: tests/fixtures/samples/try_catch_with_stubs.dex
  Lp5x;->openCatch()I  (static)
    try   { Ldemo/Net;->openConnection(); return 0 }
    catch (Ljava/io/IOException;) { return 1 }
